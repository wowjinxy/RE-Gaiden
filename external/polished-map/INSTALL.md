# Install Guide

## Windows

### Install the Polished Map release

1. Download **install.bat** and **polishedmap.exe** from [the latest release](https://github.com/Rangi42/polished-map/releases).
2. Hold down Shift, right-click **install.bat**, and click "**Run as administrator**". This will install Polished Map to your account and create a shortcut on your Desktop.
3. Now you can delete the two downloaded files.
4. Double-click **Polished Map** on your Desktop to open it. If you get an error that "msvcrt140.dll is missing", you need to install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) for x86.

### Build Polished Map from source

You will need [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/); the Community edition is free.

If the pre-built release already works for you, you don't have to build it yourself.

1. On GitHub, click the green "**Code**" button and click "**Download ZIP**". This will download **polished-map-master.zip**.
2. Unzip polished-map-master.zip. This will create the **polished-map-master** folder.
3. Navigate to the polished-map-master folder in Explorer.
4. Download fltk-1.4.5-source.tar.bz2 or fltk-1.4.5-source.tar.gz from [**fltk.org**](https://www.fltk.org/software.php) to a new **polished-map-master\lib** subfolder.
5. Extract fltk-1.4.5-source.tar (you may need a program such as [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)). This will create the lib\\**fltk-1.4.5** folder.
6. Open Visual Studio, select **Open a local folder**, and open the lib\fltk-1.4.5 folder. This will automatically generate the CMake project with a configuration named **x64-Debug** by default.
7. From the Configuration dropdown, select **Manage Configurations...**, click the green plus sign to add a new configuration, and select **x86-Release** from the list. Set the **Configuration type** to **Release** and set the **Toolset** to **msvc_x86_x64**. In the list of CMake variables, uncheck the **FLTK_GRAPHICS_GDIPLUS** option and set the **FLTK_ABI_VERSION** option to **10405**.
8. Set the active Configuration to **x86-Release**.
9. In the **Solution Explorer**, switch to the **CMake Targets View**, right-click on **fltk_images**, and select **Build fltk_images**. This will also build the other required libraries: fltk, fltk_jpeg, fltk_png, and fltk_z.
10. Move all the .lib files from lib\fltk-1.4.5\out\build\x86-Release\lib\\\*.lib up to lib\\\*.lib.
11. Copy the lib\fltk-1.4.5\\**FL** folder to a new include\\**FL** folder. Also copy lib\fltk-1.4.5\out\build\x86-Release\FL\fl_config.h into include\FL.
12. Open ide\polished-map.sln in Visual Studio 2019.
13. If the Solution Configuration dropdown on the toolbar says Debug, set it to **Release**.
14. Go to **Build → Build Solution** or press F7 to build the project. This will create bin\Release\\**polishedmap.exe**.
15. Hold down Shift, right-click **install.bat**, and click "**Run as administrator**". This will install Polished Map to your account and create a shortcut on your Desktop.
